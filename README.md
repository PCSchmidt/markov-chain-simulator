# Markov Chain Stock Simulator

## Overview

The Markov Chain Stock Simulator is a web-based application that leverages Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to model and predict potential future stock price movements. This tool provides investors, analysts, and financial enthusiasts with a powerful means to visualize historical stock performance, understand price volatility, and explore possible future price trajectories based on historical data patterns.

## Features

- **Historical Price Visualization**: Display stock price history for user-specified symbols and time periods.
- **Returns Distribution Analysis**: Visualize the distribution of historical returns to understand stock volatility.
- **Markov Chain Simulation**: Generate multiple simulated future price paths using MCMC techniques.
- **Transition Probability Matrix**: Visualize the underlying Markov Chain model through a heatmap of state transition probabilities.
- **Stock Comparison**: Compare multiple stocks side-by-side for comprehensive analysis.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust simulation parameters such as number of states, time steps, and simulation count.

## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: The application retrieves historical stock data from reliable financial APIs.
2. **Data Processing**: Raw price data is transformed into returns and discretized into states.
3. **Markov Chain Modeling**: A transition probability matrix is constructed based on historical state transitions.
4. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Multiple price paths are simulated using the Markov Chain model.
5. **Visualization**: Results are presented through interactive charts and heatmaps.

## Why It's Useful

1. **Risk Assessment**: By simulating multiple potential future scenarios, users can better understand the range of possible outcomes and assess investment risks.
2. **Pattern Recognition**: The transition probability matrix helps identify recurring patterns in stock price movements.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: The ability to compare multiple stocks allows for informed decision-making in portfolio diversification.
4. **Educational Tool**: Serves as an excellent resource for learning about Markov Chains, Monte Carlo methods, and their applications in finance.
5. **Hypothesis Testing**: Users can test various market hypotheses by adjusting simulation parameters and observing outcomes.

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, Plotly.js
- **Key Libraries**: pandas, numpy, yfinance

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/markov-chain-stock-simulator.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with more sophisticated financial models
- Real-time data streaming for live simulations
- Machine learning integration for improved state discretization
- User accounts for saving and sharing analyses
